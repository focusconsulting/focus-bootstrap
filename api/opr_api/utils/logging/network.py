#
# Logging of network connections.
#
# For outgoing connections, log these:
#
# - Before connecting, the IP addresses that the host name resolves to (names often resolve to a
#   different IP within AWS due to different DNS servers, geolocation, or VPC endpoints).
#
# - After successful connection:
#   - The actual IP address used.
#   - SSL certificate details (for security auditing or troubleshooting).
